CLOCK CLASS TESTER PROGRAM
--------------------------

  Creating a new clock with angle 90 and ts 90: 
    New clock created: 0.0:0.0:0.0
    Testing validateAngleArg(90.0)....
      sending '  90.0 degrees', expecting double value   90.0 - got   90.0
    Testing validateTimeSliceArg(30.0)....
      sending '  30.0 degrees', expecting double value   30.0 - got   30.0


  Creating a new clock with angle 0 and ts 90: 
    New clock created: 0.0:0.0:0.0
    Testing validateAngleArg(0)....
      sending '  0 degrees', expecting double value   0.0 - got   0.0
    Testing validateTimeSliceArg(0.0)....
      sending '  0 degrees', expecting double value   0.0 - got   0.0


  Creating a new clock with angle 1000 and ts 1000 
    New clock created: 0.0:0.0:0.0
    Testing validateAngleArg(1000)....
      sending '  1000 degrees', expecting double value   1000 - Exception thrown: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid angle value
    Testing validateTimeSliceArg(1000)....
      sending '  1000 degrees', expecting double value   1000 - got   1000
