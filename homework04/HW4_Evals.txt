A total of one point each for the following:

class Clock             : Exists, coding style acceptable   -  1 point
Constructor             : Freebie, since not really needed  -  1 point
tick                    : works                             -  1 point
getHourHandAngle        : works                             -  1 point
getMinuteHandAngle      : works                             -  1 point
getHandAngle            : works                             -  1 point
getTotalSeconds         : works                             -  1 point

Test Code               : Contains some method test code    -  1 point

class ClockSolver       : Exists, coding style acceptable   -  1 point
Constructor             : Exists, works properly            -  1 point
HandleInitialArguments  : works                             -  0 points (0/7)
   could not check any tests; infinite loop occurred with every one

main exists             : works                             -  1 point
works as advertised     : passes all tests in the series    -  4.5 points
   could not check any tests; infinite loop occurred with every one
   however, you wrote a bunch of code, so I'm allowing 1/2 credit for that

Files in Git            : two files required                -  2 points
Coding Style overall    : coding style acceptable           -  1 point


Total 20.50 out of 27 = 75.93% which is a C
